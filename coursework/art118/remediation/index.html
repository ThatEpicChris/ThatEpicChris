      This 'first iteration' demonstrated the usage of the Pen Tool and the creation of bezier curves. This process took two weeks to complete. The first week involved selecting the photo and beginning the remediation process. The image that I chose was of the Sydney ICC, for it's geometric architecture and stark lighting. Throughout the first week I began to extensively draw all the details in the bottom right portion of the image. In hindsight, this was not as effecient - whereas during the second week I began to work top-down; bigger shapes to smaller details. Throughout the extensive usage of the pen tool I found myself becoming more confident with creating bezier curves and manipulating them on various shapes.<br>
      With the outline complete, I selected all the lines drawn and transitioned to using Live Paint. This created shapes from all of the lines I created.  From here, I alternated between the Eyedropper Tool and the Live Paint bucket to fill in the shapes with sampled colors to create a remediated image of the Sydney ICC.

      The second iteration employs the usage of the Blob Brush to draw vector shapes and color a remediated image. I selected an image of a mountainscape with a simple yet vivid color palette with some shadow lines being gradual and others stark. I utilized the iPad Pro with Apple Pencil (via Sidecar) as my drawing tablet of choice and began the rediation process. I had the image on a locked layer titled "Pixels" with a layer above for my blob brush shapes. I then alternated between the eyedropper tool and the Blob Brush to draw shapes. For larger shapes, I simply drew an outline with a closed perimeter and removed the interior shape via the Direct Select Tool to effectively fill the outline in. Once I neared completion of the image, I created a layer that was nestled between the Blob Brush shapes and the "Pixels". This layer contained one neon square - for the sole purpose of finding 'holes' within the Blob Brush layer. I went through the process of sampling nearby shapes colors and expanding them via the Blob Brush tool to close these holes. With no holes remaining, I turned this layer off but left it within the file incase I would need it in the future.

      Much like the first iteration, this remediated image does not demonstrate a form of hyperrealism. As this image is a photograph of nature with no manmade structures, there is no propaganda nor any presence of semiotics. Purely put - this is a picture of a nature that conveys no ideology, meaning, or message.
